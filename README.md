# Code Refactor Starter Code

* In this project, I Refractored starter code in order to make the website more accessible and easier to comprehend.

## Purpose

* During the project, I worked on fixing links that were not properly taking one to the correct place when it was clicked.

* I was able to condense the material in CSS and organize it where the code is shorter and clearer.
